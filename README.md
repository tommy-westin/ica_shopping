# 🛒 ICA Shopping – Home Assistant Integration

Sync your ICA shopping lists with Home Assistant and your shopping/todo list in HA.

This also works with Google Keep, which means you can add items to your shopping list
using Google Assistant (voice) and have them automatically synced to your ICA shopping list

## Limitations at the Moment

**Polling Interval (Google Keep):**  
While changes made in Home Assistant are instantly reflected in Google Keep, the reverse is not immediate.  
The integration polls Google Keep for updates every 15 minutes.  
Changes made directly in Google Keep will appear in Home Assistant after the next polling cycle.
[Read more about the limitations here.](https://github.com/watkins-matt/home-assistant-google-keep-sync?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations)

**ICA API:**  
Changes made to your ICA shopping list (e.g. via the ICA app or website) will **not** appear immediately in Home Assistant.  
The integration does **not** support real-time updates, so you’ll need to manually trigger a refresh to fetch the latest version of the list.


## Installation via HACS

Add Custom Repository:

Open HACS in Home Assistant.
Click on the ... in the top right corner and select Custom repositories.

## Example voice assistant

Add this to configuration.yaml to create an intent to use voice assistant. This code will override the shoppinglist build into voice assistant. 

```yaml
intent_script:
  # Röststyrning för att lägga till i ICAs inköpslista
  IcaAddItem:
    action:
      - service: ica_shopping.add_item
        data:
          text: >
            {{ item | trim }}
    speech:
      text: "Okej, jag lade till {{ item }}."

  # Röststyrning för att uppdatera inköpslistan
  IcaRefresh:
    action:
      - service: ica_shopping.refresh
    speech:
      text: "Jag uppdaterade inköpslistan."

  # Override för interna shoppinglist (Home Assistant built-in)
  HassShoppingListAddItem:
    action:
      - service: ica_shopping.add_item
        data:
          text: "{{ item | trim }}"
    speech:
      text: "Okej, jag lade till {{ item }} på ICA."
